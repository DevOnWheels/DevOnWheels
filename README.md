### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Matthias, I'm a software engineer based in Freiburg, near the Black Forest in 
Germany. I'm a full-time employee currently working at a german automotive supplier. In 
2019 I started a small business where I offer consulting and developing services for other 
small businesses and associations of all kind. I've a disability called congenital 
muscle dystrophy (CMD), so I got the name "Dev On Wheels" and used it for my business. 
It's nice to meet you! 

#### ðŸ›  Iâ€™m currently working on ...

... my small business [devonwheels.net](https://www.devonwheels.net), my personal website 
[labsch.net](https://matthias.labsch.net) and several client websites for a physiotherapist, 
personal coaches and an international martial arts association.

I'm also dipping my toe into Arduino programming to develop a pet project of mine, a 
wheelie detector for my wheelchair ðŸ˜œðŸ˜‚ If the fun part works, I'll develop some serious 
applications for it as well.

For my work I'm using:

#### ðŸ“š Iâ€™m trying to learn ...

- ... C++ to program my Arduino micro controller.
- ... Docker and AWS for my main job.
- ... ReactJS for various applications.

#### ðŸ’¬ Let's talk about ...

- ... living as a disabled software developer and occasional wheelchair user!
- ... web development! Especially CSS tricks and structures (ITCSS, Modules, ...), 
accessibility and content management will catch my attention.

#### ðŸ’¡ Fun facts

- Despite my disability, I'm practicing japanese martial arts. I hold a black belt in 
Kenjutsu (fencing) and two gradings in Jujutsu (grappling).
- In my free time I'm building and painting miniatures or trying to finish my RC truck 
in 1:14 scale. And it will never be finished, I'm afraid ðŸ˜…
